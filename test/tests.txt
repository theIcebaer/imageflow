# This file should organize all necessary testcases. First we have to list everything.
# Unittesting Basic components:
# - Cond net wrapper does always give back correct condition network with stuff
#       - mobilenet
#       - resnet
# - initialization strategy does work as intended for all networks where it is used.
#       - xavier
#       - gaussian
#       - CinnBasic
#       - CinnMultiresolution

# "Integration Testing" for different experiment setups.
# - supervised training with:
#   - no conditioning network
#   - conditioning network with training from scratch
#   - conditioning network with pretrained resnet
#   - " mobilenet
