# Imageflow
This project is part of my MA-Thesis, it builds 
upon the idea of the voxelmorph framework, but tries 
to implement flow
field generation via normalized flows.
To build it locally clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/theIcebaer/imageflow.git
```
Then install the project as local development package:
```
cd repo
pip install -e .
```
Scripts for unsupervised and supervised training can be found in /scritps.
